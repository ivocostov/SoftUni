"""
Here comes the final and the most interesting part â€“ the Final ranking of the candidate-interns. The final ranking is
determined by the points of the interview tasks and by the points from the exams in SoftUni. Here is your final task.
You will receive some lines of input in the format "{contest}:{password for contest}" until you receive
"end of contests". Save that data because you will need it later. After that you will receive other type of inputs
in format "{contest}=>{password}=>{username}=>{points}" until you receive "end of submissions".
